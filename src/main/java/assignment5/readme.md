Assignment 5 task 3:


v - Vertex- It defindes the 3d point and has x,y and z coordinates

vt - Vertex texture - defines the 2D texture coodinates

vn - Vertex normal - Defines the 3D normal vector for lighting and shading effects

f - face - defined a triangle or polygon using indices into the v,vt and vn lists

8v entries represent the  8 corners of the cube

14 vt - texture coordinates 

6 normals since we have six faces in a cube

12 f since cube has a square face and we need atleast 2 triangles to make a square
